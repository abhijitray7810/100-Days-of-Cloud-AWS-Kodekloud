- Click "Allocate Elastic IP address"
- Select "Amazon's pool of IPv4 addresses"
- Add tag: Name = `nautilus-eip`
- Click "Allocate"

### 4. Associate Elastic IP with EC2 Instance
- Select the newly created Elastic IP
- Click "Actions" → "Associate Elastic IP address"
- Select Instance: `nautilus-ec2`
- Click "Associate"

### 5. Verify Setup
- Check EC2 instance has the Elastic IP assigned
- Confirm the Elastic IP is tagged as `nautilus-eip`
- Verify the instance is in running state

## Important Notes
- All resources must be created in **us-east-1** region only
- Instance type must be **t2.micro**

When establishing infrastructure on the AWS cloud, Identity and Access Management (IAM) is among the first and most critical services to configure. IAM facilitates the creation and management of user accounts, groups, roles, policies, and other access controls.

Create an IAM role as below:

1) IAM role name must be iamrole_jim.

2) Entity type must be AWS Service and use case must be EC2.

3) Attach a policy named iampolicy_jim.



Use the below given AWS Credentials: (You can run the showcreds command on aws-client host to retrieve these credentials)
